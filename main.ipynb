    "At the time this competition first presented in Kaggle (5 years ago) the site was getting more than 100 million visitors every single month, now this number increased to 300 million visitors per month, anyone can ask question about the topic he or she want and get answers and Insights from others.\n"

    "After identifying them they can provide answers to newly asked questions instantly depending on its high similarity to a question already answered on Quora.<br>\n",
    "This process can improve a lot the User Experience (UX) in the application web or mobile because of three important ideas:<br>\n",
    "- it will provide answers instantly for the questioner.<br>\n",
    "- it also provides the best ones which may be upvoted by more people in the old question.<br>\n",
    "- it helps the user who want to search about a question to quickly find the right answer instead of being overwhelmed by a lot of questions.\n"
